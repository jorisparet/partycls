Support and contribution
========================

If you wish to contribute or report an issue, feel free to `contact us <mailto:joris.paret@gmail.com>`_ or to use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/jorisparet/partycls/issues>`_ and `pull requests <https://github.com/jorisparet/partycls/pulls>`_ from the `code repository <https://github.com/jorisparet/partycls>`_.

We largely follow the `GitHub flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_ to integrate community contributions. In essence:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from ``master``.
3. Unleash your creativity.
4. Run the tests.
5. Open a pull request.

We also welcome contributions from other platforms, such as GitLab instances. Just let us know where to find your feature branch.
